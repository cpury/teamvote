_TeamVote_ was written by [__Max Schumacher__](/contact) in 2015 as an exercise in Full Stack Engineering, but also because he couldn't find a tool that simply did one thing well:

_Help a team brainstorm. Quick and easy._


For the code, he used the amazing new [__Meteor__](https://meteor.com/) framework for real-time apps.

Other software, libraries and packages include:

* [__MongoDB__](https://www.mongodb.org/): A fast and modern NoSQL storage.
* [__Twitter Bootstrap__](http://getbootstrap.com/): Makes everything beautiful and responsive.
* [__accounts-ui-bootstrap-3__](https://atmospherejs.com/ian/accounts-ui-bootstrap-3): Meteor accounts UI styled with Bootstrap.
