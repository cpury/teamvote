_TeamVote_ was written by Max Schumacher in 2015 as an exercise in Full Stack Development, but also because he couldn't find a tool that simply did one thing:

Help a team brainstorm. Quick and easy.


It makes use of a bunch of technologies, including but not limited to:

* [Meteor](https://meteor.com/): An amazing new framework for real-time apps.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/): Makes everything beautiful and responsive from the start
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/): A fast and modern NoSQL storage.
